Fire history metadata

This directory contains the following geotiff images:

- "fire_2018.tif"
- "fire_2019.tif"
- "fire_2020.tif"

They are provided as 30 x 30 m rasters (epsg: 32750). There are three bands:

- Band 1: days since fire as of January 1 of that year (this will eventually be converted to years since fire)
- Band 2: fire severity calculated with the model from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112863 where
            0 = unburnt between 2001 - fire year
            1 = unburnt (but within a fire perimeter) but predicted unburnt (see description in paper)
            2 = low severity
            3 = mid severity
            4 = high severity
            5 = canopy consumed by fire
            6 - 7 = mixed pixels containing multiple severity scores (occuring on the edges of fires) to remove
            8 = within a fire perimter, but we do not have a severity score (these need to be removed because a severity score is required to run SFD/Levels models
- Band 3: a numerical identifier to link back to each fire perimeter

The difference between 2018, 2019 and 2020 is new fires occured in the years 2018 and 2019, and the time since fire
needs to be updated according to each flowering year.
